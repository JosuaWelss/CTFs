# Part2

[Part2](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart2)

Changing up the structure to find out what looks good to me. 
From now on I will only answer "real questions" e.g. not something like 'what command is used to list the content of a directory'.
This should lead to better writeups but also makes writeups like this one very short because it is really basic stuff, that I know already.
At the end of every writeup I will write some final thoughts.



file xxxx shows filetype of xxxx

logs are in /var/log

/root is the home directory for root

## Final thoughts:

It was a fast refresh on most things. Two things that I did not know:

#### -/root is the home directory of the root user (I mean sounds obvious but I did not "actively" know it)

#### -Logs are kept in /var/log and /var stores data that is frequently used
