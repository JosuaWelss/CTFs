#### If we wanted to cleanly kill a process, what signal would we send it?

I tried sigkill which did not work. It turned out to be sigterm, that was meant by cleanly apparently.

#### Crontabs

Interesting, never used these yet. Crontab -e opens the config for the crontabs

## Final thoughts:

Cronjobs are new, I know now where logs are apart from this not much taken from this room.
