Session 2: Preparing the environment

1. Make sure the system is updated. Use a non-admin profile.

2. Firefox is recmommended for privacy. Other privacy focused browsers could be an alternative.
   Set the browsers privacy settings to strict. Some useful Extensions are: multi-account containers, fireshot,uBlockOrigin, DownThemAll,
   ScapBee, search by image. OBS or Hunchly for documentation.
   
3. Log out of all websites before searching.

4. Use a password manager for easy account and password management.

5. Use a VM.
	=> prevents malware from spreading.
	=> easy to export and archive.
	=> linux is more secure in general (most threat actores target windows)
	=> snapshots for clean research enviroment

6. Reduce traces left. Website Servers log your OS, IP, Browserfingerprint etc. They can reverse search the ip to reveal the host.
	=> VPNs (don't use the most popular ones, they might be listed)
	=> mobile Router with prepaid sim card
	
7. Use common sense
	=> care with downloads from unknown sources
	=> long, strong passwords
	=> store documentation on secured drive
	=> never mix private and osint
	=> create encrypted backups
	=> don't connect unknown devices to the computer
	=> don't connect to unknown networks
