I googled for a solution to the first step (finding instagram) since Tilman wagner deleted the link from his twitter to instagram and was not findable with basic means
His instagram: https://www.instagram.com/twoneplus
Sadly there is no easy way to search old posts so I had to manually find the picture with the car: 

https://www.instagram.com/p/CAFBUw0APD1/
On the source code of the page I was a bit lost, after reading some posts on stackoverflow I found out I had to search for media?id which gave me the correct id.

Can also just go into dev tools>network tab>xhr>search for media id on the left

Solution4:Tugger

Easy google dork to find the solution as the first search result:
"Christiaan Triebert" shadows sun dial

clicking on api reveals raw data that is searchable

Solution9: totalAC

dev tools + network tab and look at the json. toalAC (total Aircrafts) makes sense

Solution10:53.5566, 10.0220

looked up the solution since it seems like the picutre is not on twitter anymore.
Twitter only shows a handful of results if someone looks up for tweets from specific dates
which is not enough if an account posts as much as this one, I found no way to increase the amount of search results.

Using archive.org to get the website to show (http://web.archive.org/web/20220331224957/https://www.hhlab.de/) then uploading the picture to https://exif.tools/ showed the path:
C:\Users\Marc\Google Drive\SHZ\Bilder\Philipp_182x182_rund.png

Elephind is down, the replacements did not seem to find the solution so I had to look it up.

Solution16: Johannes-Rau-Platz

A bit of an reverse image search found it (google image search).

Solution17: 0154

Yandex image search with a bit of cutting the picture. This linked me here (https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Norway_2016-03-13_(26434496772).jpg)
The description states:  Oslo. Devant la Gare Centrale, which in  turn if looked for in google earth
shows the postal code 0154. I could not find the exact spot where the picture was taken tho.

Solution18: 286	

Looking at the post and the hashtags,the location holzmarkt fits, there are some photos on google earth
and after pasting the location from the url to suncalc it was a matter of 2 tries to get the solution
