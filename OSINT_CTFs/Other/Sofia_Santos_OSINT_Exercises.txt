Exercise 001:
Had to use the walkthrough because I did not know some key ideas when looking for this kind of location.
So first step is to read the text and look at the image carefully.
It says the picture is from Kiffa. Kiffa is a city in Mauretania. 
The picture has a building on the right and left side of a road in it.
And the road seems to take a dip and then go upwards some kind of hill.
The end of the street seemingly has no buildings on either side anymore.
There are trees behind the right building.
And there are electricity poles alongside the left side of the building.
The road itself is paved.

First solution:
Looking at Kiffa in google maps we do not find many view points. We can see there are only few paved roads though.
We can also clearly see a few spots with a lot of green, presumably trees. In the south there
is a spot that could be it, there are trees ad the city's border and the road is paved.
To confirm a spot we need a feature from google earth pro, the timelapse feature. Navigation to the year
2013 (the date the picture was taken according to the tweet) already kind of confirms that this is the correct spot.
The position of buildings and trees match the picture. We can use the timelapse to go to later/earlier dates
and see that the poles indeed are there and they cast a similiar shadow to the picture so this has to be the spot.

Exercise 002:
What do we know:
A train station in Flinders Street is depicted. Flinders Street is in Melbourne, Australia.
In the background there is a couple of buildings. One of them has the Acronym "HWT" on it.
The buildings all look a bit like hotels.

First Solution: Flinders Street railway station.
https://www.google.com/maps/@-37.818446,144.9666179,3a,90y,138.43h,90.51t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipMUUHaCMNJpv2oZLPoH1YAMTu-9zqAVt_bv9Pg!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMUUHaCMNJpv2oZLPoH1YAMTu-9zqAVt_bv9Pg%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi0-ya242.37346-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352?coh=205409&entry=ttu
Relatively easy to find, after searching for the station on google maps, this is the viewpoint nearly exaclty where the picture was taken.

Second Solution:
The tallest building looks like it could be the HWT building (Melbourne, HWT Tower - Southbank ), there is another kind of blue building next to it,
a bit in the background which could be taller so we have to check in google earth pro. (which crashed)
Normal google earth works as well here fortunately. 


Exercise 003:
The photo was taken at 39.9308°N 32.7989°E. The Presidental (Palace) Complex in Ankara, Turkey.
A simple quick reverse image search with google shows some articles, the third result
(https://www.atalayar.com/en/articulo/politics/somalia-erdogans-spearhead-east-africa/20200508113246145709.html)
mentions the palace in the caption of the picture) 
The highest building is the FOCUS Apartments by Central Equity, google says the height is about 166 m 
The Arts Centre Melbourne Spire on the left side of the picture is slightly smaller (162m )


Exercise 004: 
No historical data associated with the picture this time, just a simple image search.

First solution: Google image search works for this one, the first result (taliana island) is wrong though. It 
looks similiar but the neighbouring island look slightly different. The second result shows the correct one,
"oan resort" on oan island, which looks exactly like the picture.

Second solution:
Coordinates are: 7.363983428680303, 151.7569308135361

Third solution:
Playing around with the view in maps, reveals the picture was taken with the camera facing north west.


Exercise 005:
What we know: 
Picture was takin in a zoo, on January 15, 2023 at 2pm LOCAL time.

First solution: google images returns a couple of images. The big rock on the left side in the picture seems to be from San Diego Zoo.
They indeed do have polar bears and the camera in the zoo also shows the big rock + the smaller "rock ramp" in the centre, albeit from a different angle.
Looking at the san diego polar bear cam broadcast on youtube is the trick here. Looking through the hour long broadcast it is possible to find the correct angle, thus
confirming the location.
Alternative way would have been to google for polar bear zoo cam. There should not be many results.
So the solution is "San Diego Zoo". 

Second solution: 
Found this website: https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/KSAN/date/2023-1-15 which shows the weather on the day, with nice graphics.
Since the picture was taken at 2 pm, the temperature was around 62° Fahrenheit, roughly 17 ° Celsius.
To check if this is realistic I googled for "average temperatues by month san diego" and found out that
indeed the temperatures are somewhat realistic, with san diego having on average 28 days with temperatures above 16 ° Celsius in January.

Third solution:
First I looked at the social media accounts of the zoo linked in the youtube broadcast and see if there is metadata of a picture.
But there was not. So I looked at earth and tried to see if the different zoo areas are mentioned.
They are but I could not identify the part with the polar bears on first glance, so I looked at the zoo's wikipedia page. I found out 
the bears are located at the "Polar Bear Plunge". I then also looked for a map of the zoo, which you can download on the zoo's website.
Now it was easy. Searching for "Polar Bear Plunge" on google maps also found the exact location.
The coordinates are: 32.73445334536855, -117.15458197420872


Exercise 006:
What we know: January, 19th, 2023. Picture posted from a jounralist with 140k followers. TTP carried out a suicide attack on police post in Khyber city.

Solution:
Since the exercise gives us the exact sentence I just searched for it in google (with "") and found it + all the walkthroughs for this ctf.
Since there are no other articles or anything I already suspect the news to be fake.
tineye also shows that this picture was used a lot of times in the past. For example from prwatch.org in 2008. So the picture indeed is not from this event.
Wikipedia lists this event in january 2023 though so this is becoming more difficult. Luckily there is a source which links to reuters.com, one of the most neutral news organisations in the world.
Solution: it is actually true, the news are not fake, albeit it looked like they are on first glance.
The picture is from another event in the past.
