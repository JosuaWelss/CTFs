Solutions Task 2: ks{H}, ks{thomas straussman}

Both solutions come from the introduction.

First solution: First sentence on thomas twitter profile. (https://x.com/tstraussman?lang=en)

Solutions Task 4: sfp_accounts,  1346173539712380929

First solution: Running spiderfoot (usernames have to be in quotes), under "browse" the module used to find social media accounts is called "sfp_accounts"
Second solution: I did not really understand this one, so after a while I had to look it up, apparently it was to be solved 
with the help of the website shadowban.eu, but that website is no more so it seems not solvable so I fully looked up the solution to this one.

Solutions Task 5: Koblenz, Germany, December 25th, Gotank, 90 Day Fiancee

First solution: reveye does a fabulous job and the reverse image search returns that the vacation destination was Koblenz in Germany
Second solution: Francesca congratulates her mother in one post
Third solution: The name is mentioned in another post.
Fourth solution: The hashtag to the sow is mentioned in yet another post.

Solutions Task 6: Hans Minik, Nuuk, Greenland, ks{ww4ju}, ks{1qaz2wsx}, Emilia Moller, straussmanthom@mail.com

First solution: Just following the instructions 
Second solution: Looking at hans history we see him mentioning he was born in greenland. Francesca posted a picture that 
google reverse image search identified as beeing from Nuuk in greenland so this is the likely solution, since these two coworkers seem
to be good friends
Third solution: I found another pastebin before in the snapshot of the archive, but these were not the solution.
The hint told me there is another one in the snapshots. The next snapshot had the correct pastebin.
Fourth solution: The pastebin also contained a link to a ghostbin with a password
Fifth solution: Confusingly the ghostbin from the second pastebin did not exist. But there was also a link in the first paste.
That one worked and revealed the name of the mistress after entering the password.
Sixth solution: the pastebin from the fifth question contained his email.
