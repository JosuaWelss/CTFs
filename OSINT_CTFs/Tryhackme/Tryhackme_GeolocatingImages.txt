Solution Task 2: china 

A simple reverse imagesearch with yandex and google for confirmation shows it is an oil bubble in karamay

Solution Task 4: Wrigleyville Sports

First looked through streets in sheffield with no findings, then noticed the cars drive on the right side and
understood that "st" probably stands for street and "av" for avenue so I just googled sheffield avenue, which 
led me to chicago so I just had to use google maps to find the interception of sheffield avenue and addison street,
turn around and there is the sportsbar where the picture was taken from.

Solution Task 6: Meudon Observatory

Looks middle european could be the eifel tower. Quickly using google earth confirms that, adjusting the angle to 
have the same view as in the picture and after a short time the building is on the screen. Its called an 
equatorial table dome. The solution is Meudon Observatory but the Meudon Observatory is more than just this building
(wikipedia Meudon Observatory redirects to Paris Observatory).

Solution Task 7: Abbey Road

Looks super britsh, a quick search for the car nameplates tells me LD stands for London.
So a crossing/street in London. The yellow street lanterns did not amount to anything, but 
googling around with the war memorial (it seemed like one) got me closer and closer. Searching for
zebra crossing war memorial london finally got me to the famous spot where the Beatles created history.
